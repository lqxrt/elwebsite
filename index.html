						Throughout most of history, the amount of waste generated by humans was insignificant due to low
						levels of population density and exploitation of natural resources. That past is now not even
						remotely close to our reality.
						<br>
						Education and awareness in the area of waste and waste management is increasingly important from
						a global perspective of resource management.
						<br>
						Waste management practices are not uniform among countries (developed and developing nations);
						regions (urban and rural areas), and residential and industrial sectors can all take different
						approaches.
						<br>
						Proper management of waste is important for building sustainable and livable cities, but it
						remains a challenge for many developing countries and cities. Effective waste management is
						quite expensive, usually comprising 20%–50% of municipal budgets.

						<h2>How much waste is generated in India?</h2>
						<p>India is getting buried under mounds of garbage as the country has been generating more than
							1.50
							lakh metric tonne (MT) of solid waste every day. Worse - approximately 90 per cent (1,35,000
							MT per day)
							of the total amount is collected.

							explosive and contributes to the greenhouse effect.</p>

						<h2>What can we do to efficently manage waste?</h2>
						<p>Many don’t give a second thought to waste or the materials they discard. But there are many
							implications of waste, ranging from the inefficient use of raw materials to faulty products
							and wasted labour to the unnecessary use of energy. <br>
							Proper waste management involves the use of garbage as a valuable resource, usually by
							recycling items that don’t need to end up in a landfill yet.</p>

				<h2>Waste Management in India</h2>
				Waste management in India falls under the purview of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and
				Climate Change (MoEF&CC). In 2016, this ministry released the Solid Wastage Management (SWM) Rules,
				these rules replaced the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000 which had been in
				place for 16 years. This national policy is notable in that it has acknowledged and included the
				informal sector (waste pickers) into the waste management process for the first time.

				<h1>Some common Myths</h1>
				<p>Worrying about whether or not a particular waste is regulated, hazardous, or should be recycled can
					be stressful enough – but the problem can be frustratingly compounded by circulating myths. Waste
					management (especially that of regulated non-hazardous and hazardous waste) is an area where you
					really can’t afford to be wrong.</p>
				<h2>Myth: Recycling solves all our waste problems.</h2>
				<strong>Truth:</strong> Recycling is a valuable and promising process, but the current system is
				far from perfect. There are several long-range problems that need solutions, including the fact
				that most
				products are not actually designed for recycling. This means that it can be costly to recover
				and reprocess materials.

				<h2>Myth: Biodegradable waste is eco-friendly</h2>
				<strong>Truth:</strong> Many people assume that biodegradable waste is ok for the environment.
				Some also assume that it doesn’t need to be recycled because it breaks down naturally in
				landfills.
				Biodegradable waste releases greenhouse gases in the forms of methane and carbon dioxide. When
				these greenhouse gases leak into our atmosphere, they take their toll on the environment –
				contributing to universal issues such as global warming.
