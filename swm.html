                <ol>
                    <li>Waste segregation at source is mandatory. Households are required to separate waste into
                        three streams - Organic or Biodegradable waste, Dry waste (such as plastic, paper, metal and
                        wood),
                        and Domestic
                        Hazardous waste (diapers, napkins, mosquito repellents, cleaning agents). Further, bulk waste
                        generators
                        such as hotels and hospitals are expected to treat organic waste either onsite or by
                        collaborating
                        with
                        the urban local body.
                    </li>
                    <li>Municipalities and urban local bodies have been directed to include informal waste pickers and
                        rag pickers into their waste management process. This is the first time that national policy has
                        acknowledged and included the informal sector into the waste management process. India has over
                        1.5 million subsistence informal waste pickers and including them into the formal waste
                        management system represents an opportunity for urban local bodies to streamline their
                        operations, while provide the waste pickers with better income opportunities.</li>
                    <li>Manufacturers of fast-moving consumer goods FMCG that use non-biodegradable packaging are
                        required to put in place a system to collect the packaging waste generated due to their
                        production.</li>
                    <li>Urban local bodies have been given a provision to charge bulk generators a user fee to collect
                        and process their waste. Additionally spot fines may be levied on people burning garbage or
                        discarding it in public places.</li>
                    <li>No non-recyclable waste having a calorific value of 1,500 Kcal/kg or more is permitted in
                        landfills. These wastes should either be utilized for generating energy or for preparing refuse
                        derived fuel. It may also be used for co-processing in cement or thermal power plants.</li>
